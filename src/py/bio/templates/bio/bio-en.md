Dimmu Saurus (Bulgarian: *Димозавъръ*) is a musical project dedicated to blues, metal, rock and classical music, and other fun genres. It was founded in Stara Zagora, Bulgaria, and currently consists of one member – myself, the Black Dimosaur (my portrait is hanging on top of the page).

I created this project, because I wanted to write music that does not follow any rules, nor that it suffers from any censorship or restrictions. The way all music should be.

### The beginning
Back in 1998, when I was in primary school, I recorded my first album on a tape. I named it “The Power of Wind”. The equipment in my recording studio was, as follows:

1. A Hitachi boombox from the 80s
2. A plastic egg full of shots which I was using as a maracas
3. The book Vladko in India in hardcover edition. I banged on it with two glue tubes.

And after adding my vocals, there was no doubt in success. I have recorded the eight songs quickly and finished the album.

### Rok boys

A few weeks later – in November 26, same year, a friend of mine, my brother and me of course, we founded a rock band by the name Rok Boys. I was the drummer and also provided backing vocals, although I am the leading one on three songs. On the same day and the one after, we recorded 16 songs. During the recording session we decided to replace Vladko in India with a large hard pillow and later – with a shoe box. This way my drums sounded extremely solid and unique in a way never achieved by any other band.

Next week or more precisely on December 6, my father took back his old guitar from a friend, who borrowed it a long time ago. In consequence my brother and I started playing all day and all night long. Although, considering we are still band members, we decided that I should stick with drums and obviously – he was going to be the guitarist.

After the winter holidays the band obtained new instruments – a little drum and a synthesizer, which naturally led us to the recording of six new songs, and thus – our first album was born. We called it “1 самостоятелен”, meaning “1 independent”. After that, the band went on a hiatus.

### Music Master

Despite the short life of the band, my brother and I decided not to give up making music, so we created one of our own and named it Music Master. While the Rok Boys were taking a breath after the furious start, on December 20, 1998 we recorded our first song, “Bad Boys”. I kept playing the drums and he remained the guitarist. Only this time he was the leading singer.

We finished our first album in the end of March 1999 and we named it simply “Music Master 1”. It included 16 songs. In the end of the summer we started recording our second album titled “MM2 – The Spider” and finished it at the end of autumn. Next year we recorded a third album, including 10 songs, using our new personal computer. Unfortunately, it was destroyed because the computer failed.

The following years the band grew less and less active. In 2001 we recorded a single titled “Tora”, followed by improved versions of “Put Me Down” and “The Space Rock”, which we consider two of our best songs from “Music Master 1”. Band’s last single, titled “Dig It Up”, came out in 2003.

### Birth of Dimmu Saurus

Let’s get back in time to the year 2000. It was June 12, and I was browsing a CD that came with a computer magazine. It wasn’t long before I stumbled upon a music notation program named Melody Assistant. I immediately started exploring it and wrote my first piece of music the very same day. I named it “Kefos”, which approximately translates as “Joy”. As time passed, I continued discovering more and more features of the program which naturally translated into more and more complex compositions. Of course, the decreasing disharmony lead to the fact that other people finally realized that the sounds coming out of my computer were music. Despite of this, I decided not to publish these primordial ideas on the Internet. They belong in the archive.

In the year 2001, I decided to make a song that is listenable, and potentially enjoyable by the others. By this time I was also very much influenced by the idea of tracker music, so I began experimenting. I used a song originally performed by Billy Idol to create the instruments and rhythms. Later, in June 2002, “I feel worse” was born.

The following two years I fell into a creative crisis and music almost became a thing of the past. At this time, I also stopped playing the guitar.

### Renaissance

Then the story jumps to the summer of 2004, when I went back to writing music again. The first tune from this period is “Мойто” (“Mine”, or ”My Thing”) and was born without much effort. One evening I wanted to hear how a guitar riff, that I invented back in 1999 would sound, if drums and bass guitar were playing along. On the next day, Deus ex Machina started spinning at full speed and through my hands, which served only as an instrument, the music emerged. While I was working, I thought to myself, “I want to make a great tune out of this one”. And so I did!

After “Mine”, I became very productive. In the next two years I wrote eight more tunes, that sounded better and better.

In 2006, I began experimenting with different techniques, both in terms of recording and music composition. At the end of the summer, I decided to turn a poem written a year ago, into a black metal song and then, the outstanding blockbuster “С.М.Р.А.Д.” (S.T.I.N.K.) was born. This was my first real song in which I actually sing. It was also the first time I used a real guitar instead of computer generated sound. I played my good old acoustic Cremona Rose for the recording. Of course, I still had to use the computer to add distortion and effects, to make it sound “trve” and evil. I wanted the entire song to be similar to the early Black Metal music from the 1990s. As you can imagine, the vocal part, or shall I say, the screaming part, was also “trve”.

### Up, up and away

Although metal music has many different subgenres and it inspired me a lot, I wanted to explore different music styles. So it was the year 2007 when I discovered the blues music and especially the Delta blues from the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. Thanks to this whole new world I found, I created a few acoustic songs and recorded them in 2008 and 2009.

At this time I also began experimenting with classical music, slowly but steadily increasing the number of instruments and of course – the complexity of compositions as they manifestations of the majestic and megalomaniac ideas that popped into my mind over time. The first result of these efforts is the suite “Battle for the hill”.

In the year 2010 I plugged the guitar and in the powerful sound of the amplifier was born “The robot king” – my first song with real electric guitar.

And after this… well, I still don’t consider it to be part of the past.
